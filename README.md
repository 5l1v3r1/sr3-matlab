# SR3
SR3: Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression in MATLAB

## set up and testing
In the top-level folder, run the setup.m routine to add the
folders to your path. The runallscripts.m script should 
execute all of the subroutine tests in the test folder
(this is generally only useful for developers).

## demo
See the demo folder for example usage. The results can be 
turned into an HTML page using MATLAB's publish feature.
